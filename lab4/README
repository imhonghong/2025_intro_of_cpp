for question A, after compiling the first section code and using nm to list the object, we can see

0000000100401080 T _Z7averagePdRd
00000001004010ae T _Z7averageif
...
00000001004010da T main

in terminal.

0000000100401080 T _Z7averagePdRd 	represents the address of the function average(double*, double&) (pointer to double, reference to double) in the object file.
00000001004010ae T _Z7averageif 	represents the address of the function average(int, float) in the object file.

for question B, after compiling the second section code and using nm to list the object, we can see

$ ./lab4b
1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8

we can observe that:
char cost 1 byte to store a character,
int cost 4 bytes to store an integer,
float cost 4 bytes to store a float,
and double cost 8 bytes to store a double.

however the size of the pointer is always 8 bytes, no matter what type of data it points to.
This is because pointer stores the address of the data, and the address is always 8 bytes long.
