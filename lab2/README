There're 4 files related to the function, they are
    |___ lab2.cpp
    |___ BMI.cpp
    |___ BMI.h
    |___ Makefile

I've wrote a makefile to automatically compile the files, we can simply type
`make` at this directory, then the bash will execute the makefile script, generating lab2.exe file.
We can execute the file by typing
`./lab2.exe`
