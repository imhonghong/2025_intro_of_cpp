There're some files related to the function:
    |____ HugeInt.cpp
    |____ HugeInt.o
    |____ lab5.cpp
    |____ Makefile

We can simply type `make` in this directory, and it'll compile and generate `lab5.exe`

Type `./lab5` to execute the `lab5.exe`
we can input a huge interger like 123456789000987654321,
and it'll compute the result as the question required.
